# ReactWithApolloClient
React Application with GraphQL and Apollo Boost


An application in React that:

1. Queries the GraphQL API at https://charitybase.uk/.

2. Displays the details of the charities it finds or says it cannot find them. Charities should be ordered by their income (least income first - the API supports this). Their income and spending in the last year should be displayed. Details should be anything relevant to a grant giving organisation in terms of contact: their address, email and telephone number if available.

3. Gives the details of the grants the charity has recieved. This is in the API.

4. Gives the total amount they have received in grants and shows what amount of their total income this represents. You'll need to calculate this.
